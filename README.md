# Weather app
You need to get an api key from https://openweathermap.org/api and the api key needs to be inserted into the `/src/helpers/` folder with a filename called `ApiKey.js`.
The `ApiKey.js` file must look like this:

`const ApiKey = 'your api key'; export default ApiKey;`

Please run `npm install` and `nmp start`.
